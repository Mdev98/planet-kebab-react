# Images Directory

This directory should contain the proprietary image files from the original Planet Kebab application.

## Required Image Files

### Logos
- Planet Kebab logo (main logo)
- Logo variants for different contexts (desktop/mobile headers)

### Country Flags
- `senegal-flag.png` (or .jpg) - Flag of Sénégal
- `cote-ivoire-flag.png` (or .jpg) - Flag of Côte d'Ivoire

### Background Images
- Background patterns for yellow sections
- Kebab illustrations
- Any decorative graphics

### Product Images
Product images are loaded from the API (`image_url` field), so they don't need to be stored locally.

## How to Add Images

1. Obtain the image files from the original `Mdev98/planet-kebab-app` repository
2. Copy all image files to this directory
3. Update the paths in the React components to match the actual filenames

## License Note

These images are proprietary and should not be included in the public repository without proper licensing.
