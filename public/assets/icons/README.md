# Icons Directory

This directory should contain icon files used throughout the application.

## Required Icon Files

### UI Icons
- Cart icon (shopping cart)
- Add to cart icon (plus/shopping bag)
- Social media icons (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc.)
- Navigation icons
- Any other UI icons used in the original application

## How to Add Icons

1. Obtain the icon files from the original `Mdev98/planet-kebab-app` repository
2. Copy all icon files to this directory
3. Update the paths in the React components to match the actual filenames

## Alternative

Consider using an icon library like React Icons (`react-icons`) for standard UI icons if the original application doesn't have custom icon requirements.

## License Note

Custom icons are proprietary and should not be included in the public repository without proper licensing.
